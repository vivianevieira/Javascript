# Object Oriented Javascript 


### Big Picture

The goal of this project was to build an infographic that is derived from data that is provided, as well as user input data. User information was pulled from a form and used to complete an array of objects that needed to be be appended back to the DOM. 

A 3x3 grid of tiles (9 in total) had to be generated with the human in the center tile. The other tiles would display Dino facts. Each Dino title must include at least the species, an image and a fact. The dino fact displayed should be chosen at random from at least 6 options (including your 3 methods). The Human tile must include the user’s name, and the human graphic--no fact is needed. The bird tile should include the species, image, and fact, “All birds are considered dinosaurs.”
